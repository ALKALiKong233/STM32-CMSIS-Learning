# STM32 Learning
## Introduction
This is my personal stm32 learning repo, records my learning stuffs and codes here. Generally, I followed [cpq/bare-metal-programming-guide](https://github.com/cpq/bare-metal-programming-guide) to learn, and combine his idea with CMSIS.
I tried my best to write annotation in English, but for the docs ( actually my notes ) I have to write them in Chinese bcz of my poor English.
